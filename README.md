# rock-vs-mine-prediction
# Overview

This project applies Logistic Regression to classify sonar signals as either rock or mine based on frequency response data. The goal is to develop a binary classification model that can accurately distinguish between the two categories.

# Dataset

The dataset consists of 208 instances with 60 frequency-based numerical features. Each instance is labeled as either:

R (Rock) – Sonar signal reflected from a rock.

M (Mine) – Sonar signal reflected from a metal object (mine).

# Objective

Build a Logistic Regression model for binary classification.
Preprocess the data, trained and tested the model and Evaluated the model

# Technologies & Libraries 
Python

Pandas & NumPy (Data Manipulation)

Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning & Model Evaluation)

# Implementation Steps
Data Preprocessing

Load and explore the dataset.

Scale the features for better model performance.

Model Training

Train a Logistic Regression classifier on the dataset.

Model Evaluation

Evaluated the model using accuracy_score.
